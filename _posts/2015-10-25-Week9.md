title: Week 9
---

This week we learned some more about the implementation details of `vector`, in particular that they utilize an `allocator` (such as the one we finished this week for our third project) for their initialization. Downing illustrated the reason they use an allocator object by having us implement `vector`'s constructor without an `allocator`. Because `vector<T>` is backed by an array, the constructor would involve newing up this array (resulting in a linear number of calls to `T()`), but the constructor also takes a value to initialize every element in the vector with... resulting in yet another linear number of calls to `=(T)`. To eliminate this problem, we use an `allocator`, replacing the O(N) call to `new` with a O(1) call to `allocate`, and replacing the O(N) call to `fill` with N calls to O(1) `construct` (which calls `T(T)`).

Additionally `vector` has a template parameter that allows for a user-defined `allocator` to be used for allocation. Despite using `vector`s before, the reason this template argument might not be readily apparent is because of another thing Downing went over this week: default values for parameters. The template parameter for the `allocator` that `vector` uses is defaulted to [`std::allocator`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/memory/allocator/). One ramification of defaulted parameters is that it can introduce ambiguity to function calls, such that the compiler won't know which version of a function you mean to use and will complain.

This week we discussed which containers can (and should) be used to back other things like `stack` (which would want speedy push_back and pop_back member functions) and `queue` (which would want speedy push_back and pop_front member functions).

Additionally we went over the keyword `friend`, which can be used to give a function, a method of another class, or an entire other class, access to a particular class's private members. We made use of this in the `Allocator` project to facilitate testing, but in general the use of `friend` is dangerous for [some of the same reasons getters and setters are dangerous](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2073723/core-java/why-getter-and-setter-methods-are-evil.html) (Protect your private parts, as Downing advised). The use of the `friend` keyword is not transitive (no friend-of-friend access, a la Facebook) and it is not symmetrical ("You're my friend" != "I'm your friend"... unlike Facebook?).

#### Tip of the Week

Check out this neat [article](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/10/151023121847.htm) related to the development of a new "cutting-plane" algorithm for solving optimization problems (and actually there's all kinds of neat sciency stuff discussed on this site; amazing times we live in, my friends.)
