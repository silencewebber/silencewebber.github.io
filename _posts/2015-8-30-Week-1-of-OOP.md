title: Week 1 of OOP

After two lectures in CS371P Object-Oriented Programming, the class seems to promise a good experience and I already feel like I am concretely gaining knowledge of C++. Professor Downing caters to his audience with the knowledge that we have considerable experience with Java, and teaches new keywords and syntax like "#include" and "using" in terms of the corresponding Java syntax that we're all familiar with, like "import".

He has a somewhat Socratic method of teaching as he frequently calls upon students to give their analysis of a particular line or block of code. Even if they aren't familiar with the precise syntax being used, this process still challenges students to use their prior knowledge, intuition, and deductive reasoning to make a reasonable guess, without punishing the student for being wrong. Professor Downing also has the students do this process with each other; we discuss a provided piece of code with each other, pinpointing what might be wrong and how it could be fixed. This method of teaching keeps the class engaging for the audience.

A potential shortcoming of this method is that the class might move quite slowly if too much discussion is allowed to happen, and more advanced students might get bored. However, Professor Downing does a solid job keeping the class moving, and the class moves at a good pace.

The content discussing Code Coverage and Unit Testing was very familiar to me, as we did quite a lot with both Unit Testing and Code Coverage tools with Java in CS314H.
